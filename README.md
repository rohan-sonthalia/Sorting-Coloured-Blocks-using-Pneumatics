# Sorting-Coloured-Blocks-using-Pneumatics
  Devices Used:
  1) Arduino Uno
  2) Pistons
  3) Pneumatic Tubes
  4) TCS3200 Colour Sensor
  5) 180 degree servo motor
  6) 5/3 Pneumatic solenoid valve
  
  Flow of working:
  1) The blocks enter the system one at a time via a tube attached to the top side of the system.
  2) First, the colour sensor returns the colour of the block that has just entered the system.
  3) After which the servo motor, upon which a ramp is mounted, rotates corresponding to the colour of the block.
  4) Following which the pneumatic valve pushes the piston which thereby pushes the block onto the ramp.
  5) The direction control valve then pulls back the piston, completing one entire run of the mechanism.
  6) The process is then repeated until all blocks are sorted.
